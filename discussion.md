> In the present study, we conducted an anti-AR efficacy and safety study of NVP-1703 in volunteers with AR. NVP-1703 treatment significantly alleviated the TNSS score of at week 1, 3 and 4 compared to the placebo group. In particular, NVP-1703 treatment significantly alleviated the watery rhinorrhea at week 1, 3, and 4 and nasal congestion at week 4 compared to the placebo-treated control group. Furthermore, in the evaluation of the RCAT questionnaire, NVP-1703 treatment alleviated the tear symptom, sleep disorder, and nasal congestion at 4 weeks. NVP-1703 treatment sustained IL-10 levels in the blood more highly than placebo treatment while the blood IgE and PGF2α levels significantly decreased in the NVP-1703 group compared to the placebo group.

In the present study, we conducted an study on efficacy and safety of NVP-1703 in volunteers with AR. NVP-1703 significalty improved the clinical outcomes ch as TNSS and RCAT questionnare. NVP-1703 successfuuly alleviated watery rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and tear symptom and sleep disorder. In addition, NVP-1703 also significantly improved various anti-allergic immunologic files such as speific IgE for house dust mites, PGF2a as well as IL-10, IL-10/IL-4 ratio and IL-10/IL-5 ratio. These result of our study means that NVP-1703 can antagonize the key immunologic markers associated with allergic rhinitis, which in turn results the improvement of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis.

> The administration of Bifidobacterium lactis NCC2818 to 10 individuals with seasonal AR for 8 weeks significantly attenuates AR at 8 weeks using TNSS evaluation [22]. In a study of 8 weeks of administration of Lactobacillus gasseri A5 to 118 children with asthma and allergic rhinitis symptoms, there was no significant effectiveness [23]. To evaluate antiallergic efficacy of probiotics, most of studies orally administered probiotics with rescue medication and evaluated symptom medication score (SMS). The administration of Lactobacillus salivarius PM-A0006 for 12 weeks in 240 individuals [30] or Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92 in 52 individuals for 8 weeks alleviate SMS of anti-AR drugs [31]. Treatment with Bifidobacterium longum BB536 partially alleviates in runny nose, nasal congestion and composite score, but the dosage was approximately 2 ~ 10 folds higher than other studies [32]. Treatment with Lactobacillus paracasei KW3110T in a 12-week study with 138 subjects significantly attenuates only runny nose score [33]. Treatment with Lactobacillus plantarum No.14 improved ocular SMS at first week of intake [34]. Furthermore, treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in 240 subjects for 12 weeks does not significantly improve AR symptoms [35], while the combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG with Lactobacillus gasseri TMC0356 improves nasal congestion [36]. Treatment with Lactobacillus paracasei LP-33 significantly improves the quality of life in a 4-week study using a modified pediatric rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (PRQLQ) [37,38]. The combination of Lactobacillus paracasei LP-33 with loratadine in a large-scale, 5-week study with 425 subjects, and Lactobacillus paracasei HF.A00232 in combination with levocetirizine in an 12-week study of 60 subjects improve the RQLQ, but the rhinitis symptom score is not improved [39, 40]. The mixture of Bifidobacterium longum BB536, Bifidobacterium infantis M63, and Bifidobacterium breve M-16V in the 4-week study partially improved RQLQ score and nasal symptoms [41]. These results suggest that, unlike previously reported probiotics, NVP-1703 alone without rescue medications can significantly alleviate TNSS and RCAT scores. Especially, symptoms of runny nose and nasal congestion of TNSS were simultaneously improved. (두서없이 레퍼런스를 나열한듯합니다. 정리 필요, 우리 논문의 결과와 함께 장점도 언급) 

> In the present study, we also found that blood IL-10 levels were significantly higher in the NVP-1703 group than in the placebo group, which showed a statistical significance between the groups. Furthermore, NVP-1703 treatment reduced blood IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 levels. The ratios of IL-10/IL-4, IL-10/IL-5, and IL-10/IL-13 were increased in the NVP-1703-treated group but decreased in the placebo-treated group. The administration of NVP-1703 significantly suppresses the expression of IL-4 and IL-5 and the differentiation of T cells into Th2 cells in mice with ovalbumin (OVA)- and house dust mite allergen extract (HDMA)-induced AR, while the expression of IL-10 and the differentiation of T cells into Treg cells are increased [27,28]. These results suggest that the administration of NVP-1703 can suppress the expression of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL13 and eosinophil cytokine IL-5 by inducing the IL-10 expression, a Treg cell cytokine, and Treg cell differentiation. Tomiita et al reported that the ratio of IL-10/IL-5 was significantly increased in a healthy control group when compared to active asthma and remission groups [42]. Aslam et al. reported that immunotherapy in patients with wasp-vinon allergy increased the ratio of IL-10/IL-4 [43]. 

> We also found that NVP-1703 inhibited IgE levels, particularly Df- and Dp-secific IgEs, in the blood of individuals with AR. IL-10 indirectly facilitates IL-4-induced IgG4 production in human B cells together with the suppression of IgE [44]. IL-10 inhibits IgE-induced activation of human mast cells directly in vitro [45]. The induction of IL-10 expression suppresses the expression of IgE receptors in mast cells [46]. There results suggest that the induction of IL-10 expression by NVP-1703 can suppress the production of IgE including Dp- and Df-specific IgE production. The NVP-1703-treated group also showed a significant decrease in PGF2 in the urine compared to the placebo group after 4 weeks of ingestion.

> In conclusion, NVP-1703 can reduce the secretion of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IgE, PGD2, and LTE4 and induce IL-10 expression by suppressing the activation of mast cells, eosinophils, Th2 cells, and B cells through the induction of Treg cells, resulting in the attenuation of allergic rhinitis symptoms.
