Intranasal corticosteroid is the mainstream of the treatment of allergic rhinitis by effectively reducing the Th2-drived allergic inflammation. However, there are still unmed needs for ther treatment of AR. Allergen-specific immunotherapy can induce the  allergen-specific Treg cells and subsequently the production of. IL1- and TGF-b. These immunomodulatory effects exerted the counter-regulatry inhibition of Th2-inflammations. However, allergen-specific immunotherapy has been implicated limitedly in clinical practice. Therefore,  따라서 이러한 intranasal steroid의 단점을 극복하고 면역치료처럼 immunomodulatory effect를 갖는 치료방법의 개발이 시급하다.
