Main pharmacologic treatment of AR includes antihistamines, inhaled nasal corticosteroids, and leukotriene receptor antagonists, which are effective to control AR symptoms and allergic inflammation.  

> Main pharmacologic treatment of AR includes intranasal corticosteroids (INS), antihistamines and leukotrien receptor antagonists. INS is the mainstream of the treatment of AR by effectively reducing the Th2-drived allergic inflammation. Antihistamines relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis by blocking the action of histamine released from mast cells. However, there are still unmed needs for the current  treatment of AR. 

> On the other hands, allergen-specific immunotherapy can induce the  allergen-specific Treg cells and subsequently the production of IL1- and TGF-b. 
  - These immunomodulatory effects exerted the counter-regulatry inhibition of Th2-inflammations. 
  - However, allergen-specific immunotherapy has been implicated limitedly in clinical practice. 
  - There are still unmed needs for ther treatment of AR. 

  - Therefore,  따라서 이러한 intranasal steroid의 단점을 극복하고 면역치료처럼 immunomodulatory effect를 갖는 치료방법의 개발이 시급하다.
