Main pharmacologic treatment of AR includes antihistamines, inhaled nasal corticosteroids, and leukotriene receptor antagonists, which are effective to control AR symptoms and allergic inflammation.  

> Main pharmacologic treatment of AR includes intranasal corticosteroids (INS), antihistamines and leukotrien receptor antagonists. 
> INS is the mainstream of the treatment of AR by effectively reducing the Th2-drived allergic inflammation. 
> Antihistamines relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis by blocking the action of histamine released from mast cells. 
> However, pharmacotherapy only reduces the symptoms of AR and do not change the pathologic immunologic profiles of AR. 
> On the other hands, Allergen-sepcific immunotherapy (AIT) can induce the  allergen-specific Treg cells and subsequently the production of IL1- and TGF-b. These changes of immune profiles exertd  counter-regulatry inhibition of Th2-inflammations. 
> However, AIT has been implicated limitedly in clinical practice. AIT has several disadvantages such as inconvenience and needs to risk of systemic adverse reaction. 
> Though AIT is a potential disease-modifying immune-modulatory treatment option, there are still unmed needs for the treatment of AR. 
> It is necessary to develop new immunomodulatory treatment with overcoming the limitation of pharmacologic treaments and AIT.
