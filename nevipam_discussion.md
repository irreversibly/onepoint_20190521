In the present study, we conducted an anti-AR efficacy and safety study of NVP-1703 in volunteers with AR. NVP-1703 treatment significantly alleviated the TNSS score of at week 1, 3 and 4 compared to the placebo group. In particular, NVP-1703 treatment significantly alleviated the watery rhinorrhea at week 1, 3, and 4 and nasal congestion at week 4 compared to the placebo-treated control group. Furthermore, in the evaluation of the RCAT questionnaire, NVP-1703 treatment alleviated the tear symptom, sleep disorder, and nasal congestion at 4 weeks. NVP-1703 treatment sustained IL-10 levels in the blood more highly than placebo treatment while the blood IgE and PGF2α levels significantly decreased in the NVP-1703 group compared to the placebo group.
